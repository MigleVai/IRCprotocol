# IRCprotocol
IRC protocol made with C#

This program was made for subject Computer Networks.

It is only the client side program so you have to find a IRC server to connect to, but in the code there is predefined connection.

If you want to chat, you have to run the program and write your nickname and real name and press a button. After that wait a minute until connection will be set. After that you can get all the channels from the server and after that you can choose to which channel you want to join. Channel is just a chat room with a some kind of topic. Then you should see channel connection messages and now you can type your messages to the most little boxes of all and press "Send" and chat awaaaaay... but wait.. do not worry if nobody replays to you, it might be that there are no people connected at the time ;)
